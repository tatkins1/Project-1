<div class="band"><h1> Tahj Atkinson</h1></div>

<p>Originally from Kingston, Jamaica, I am currently a third year undergraduate Chemical Engineering Student at Illinois Institute of Technology Chicago, IL. Academics aside, I am a Resident advisor on campus. My hobbies are web design/development, soccer, and trying to have an exciting social life while excelling academically. 
I am a very innovative, hardworking and social person. I consider myself to be a leader, however I understand the importance of forfeiting that role and playing my part in a team.
In my last project I worked with a team of 8 to design and build a small car (toy car sized) for the American Institute of Chemical Engineers ‘ChemE Car Competition’. My major contribution was to redesign the zinc-air fuel cells, which increased the current output by 80%.
In addition to having good teamwork and communication skills, I am very creative and I always try to find new and innovative ways to improve projects.
